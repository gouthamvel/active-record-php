This is a simple ActiveRecord implementation for PHP 5.3.


Depends on:

* PECL PDO
* MySQL 5+

Modify test.php to suite your local PHP install. The sample DB dump is provided as test.sql.

Expected output of test.php:

Array
(
    [0] => Photo Object
        (
            [row:protected] => Array
                (
                    [id] => 1
                    [user_id] => 1
                )

        )

)
User Object
(
    [row:protected] => Array
        (
            [id] => 1
            [user_name] => Love
        )

)
